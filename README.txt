This is the course project "IITB-CPU" of the course EE224 running in the Autumn semester of year 2022.
This project was made by
	- Abhijat Bharadwaj (210020002)
	- Animesh Kumar (21D070012)
	- Uvesh Mohammad (21D070084)
	- Tanishka Pradhan (210040159)

While making the project, we made following assumptions:
	- whenever R7 is changed during the carrying out of instructions other than branching (BEQ, JAL and JLR), PC will re-impose itself over R7.
	- The carry and zero flags come from adder-subtractor operations.
	- During instructions of JALR, PC is the "not-updated" location and the same is to be stored in regA.

Thank you for having a look at our code.
See you next sem :)
